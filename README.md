<h1>Udacity Nanodegree Program: Full Stack Web Development</h1>
<h2>Project 1: Movie Trailer Website</h2>
  <p>  A user can watch a movie trailer by clicking a movie poster image on the website I created.</p>
  <p>  There are 6 spiderman movies. I stored the information of each movie by using a class called Media.</p>
  <p>  In the media, I can store the story of a movie, a trailer website, a poster of the movie, and and the title.</p>
  <p>  The program is run by running entertainment_center.py in a python launcher and clicking fresh_tomatoes.html.</p>
